## üóÑÔ∏è Database

MedLoop currently does **not** use a database for storing reports or user data.  
If you want to persist user accounts, reports, or logs, you can use **MongoDB**.

### How to add MongoDB:

1. Install MongoDB and the `mongoose` package:
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
2. Connect to MongoDB in your backend (`backend/server.js`):
   ```js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
   ```
3. Add models for users, reports, etc.

**Alternative:**  
You can also use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any other database, but MongoDB is easiest for Node.js/Express.

## üì¶ Environment Variables

- Add your OpenAI API key and MongoDB URI to `backend/.env`:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/medloop
  ```

## üìù Notes

- For demo/testing, all analysis is done in-memory.
- To store reports or user data, integrate a database as described above.
